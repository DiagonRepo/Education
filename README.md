Longitudinal study of factors influencing student academic performance in CA schools
======================================================================================
- TWe can probably use the growth API data set, which contains the base API of previous year
- The data set with valid scores are from 2004 ~ 2013 for growth API
- To enable max span across multiple years with equal years apart between data sets
	- 2004 Growth API(Brandon)
	- 2007 Growth API(Irina)
	- 2010 Growth API(Cindy)
	- 2013 Growth API (Russell)
- Possible Response variables
	- API12B (could be API09B for year 2009)
- Possible Predictors
	- FULL/EMIR (2010 doesn't is NA)
	- SCI/ST_RANK (might depend on API)
	- STYPE
	- ...
- Should we look into comparing student with similar social economic need and how they perform at different schools?
